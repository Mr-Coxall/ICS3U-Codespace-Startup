Use this GitHub repo to setup an ICS3U Codespace.

It includes everything you will need to code in Python and C/C++.

<br>
To create the Codespace from this repo, click on <img src="https://github.com/Mr-Coxall/ICS3U-Codespace-Startup/raw/main/images/code.png" alt="code" height="25"> and then click on <img src="https://github.com/Mr-Coxall/ICS3U-Codespace-Startup/raw/main/images/codespace.png" alt="codespace" height="25"> to create a new Codespace.

It will take ~ 10 minutes to build your server, be patient and wait while it is building it. You can click on "View Logs" and watch the process happen. It will not take this long to open it up after the initial setup, it will take < 30 seconds from then on.

Once the Codespace is up and running, in the terminal type:
- `sh ./setup.sh`
- then follow the prompts to finish setting up your new Codespace and connect it to your GitHub account
- once your new Codespace window opens, close the old one down
