Use this repo to setup an ICS3U Codespace.

It includes everything you will need to code in Python and C/C++.

Click on <img src="https://github.com/Mr-Coxall/ICS3U-Codespace-Startup/raw/main/images/code.png" alt="code" height="25"> and then click on <img src="https://github.com/Mr-Coxall/ICS3U-Codespace-Startup/raw/main/images/codespace.png" alt="codespace" height="25"> to create a new Codespace.

It will take ~ 10 minutes to build your server, be patient and wait while it is building it. You can click on "View Logs" and watch the process happen. It will not take this long to open it up after the initial setup, it will take < 20 seconds from then on.

Once the CodeSpace is up and running, in the terminal:
- move to the home directory (`cd ~` or just `cd`)
- create a directory called "ICS3U" (`mkdir ICS3U`)
- change into the new ICS3U directory (`cd ICS3U`)
- open CodeSpaces in this new directory (`code .`)
- a new Codespace will open up, close the old one and move to the new one
- then setup your GitHub SSH keys (see: https://sites.google.com/ocsb.ca/teh-ics3ur/references/github-ssh-keys)
